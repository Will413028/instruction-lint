## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-31

While the version is below 1.0, a minor release may carry breaking changes; this one does (see
"Changed (breaking)"). Read the entry before moving a pin.

### Changed (breaking)

- `R1` chooses its limits by path glob instead of depth tiers. `[rules.R1.max_bytes]` with `root`,
  `subproject` and `nested` is removed; a config that still sets `max_bytes` under `rules.R1` fails with
  exit code 2 and a message pointing here. Entries are `[[rules.R1.limits]]` tables, the first whose
  `glob` matches the file applies, each with `max_bytes`, `max_lines` or both. A file that matches no
  entry has no size limit. Globs use the same matcher as R2 shapes and R3c specs (`*` never crosses `/`,
  `**/` matches zero or more directories). A repository config that sets `limits` replaces the preset list.

  Migration (depth tiers 12000 / 10000 / 6000 become):

  ```toml
  [[rules.R1.limits]]
  glob = "AGENTS.md"        # was root
  max_bytes = 12000

  [[rules.R1.limits]]
  glob = "*/AGENTS.md"      # was subproject (depth 1)
  max_bytes = 10000

  [[rules.R1.limits]]
  glob = "**/AGENTS.md"     # was nested (depth 2 and deeper)
  max_bytes = 6000
  ```

  Repeat the entries for `CLAUDE.md` if you lint it.
- Default limits: root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` 12000 bytes and 200 lines; `**/AGENTS.md` / `**/CLAUDE.md`
  6000 bytes and 200 lines (was 8000 and 4000 bytes by depth). The 200-line limit follows Claude Code's
  guidance of fewer than 200 lines per CLAUDE.md file.
- The pre-commit hook now sets `always_run: true` and no longer filters by `files`: rules R3a, R3b and R3c
  read test files, source and docs, so a hook that only ran when an instruction file changed missed their
  breakage. The tool still analyzes the full tracked set.

### Added

- `R1` line limit: `file is N lines, limit L` (`max_lines` in a `limits` entry).
- README and design notes: run on every commit and push, plus a weekly scheduled CI run so allowlist
  expiry warnings appear without commits.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-31

### Changed

- The README written by `instruction-lint vendor` now has an "Upgrades" section that documents the upgrade
  path (regenerate from a newer tag, open a pull request, review the diff), so a vendored copy needs no hand edits.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- Rule R2 (shape): required section headings, exact or ordered, plus optional title, one-line purpose,
  bullet-only sections and must-match patterns, per glob.
- Rule R3a (test-names): a backticked test name must be defined in a tracked test file (Go and Python
  patterns in the preset).
- Rule R3b (path-refs): a backticked path must exist; resolved against the file's directory, its
  ancestors, the root and configured `base_dirs` (heuristic).
- Rule R3c (spec-refs): `§N` references must match a numbered heading of the spec document mapped to the file.
- Rule R4 (rot): dates and issue numbers at the rule level, narrative words at `narrative_level`.
- Rule R5 (duplicates): identical lines in ancestor/descendant files at the rule level, in sibling
  files at `sibling_level`; always compares the full tracked set.
- Rule R6 (constants): copied-constant candidates, always warnings.
- Rule C1 (claude-md): `import-only` (default) or `forbid`.
- `instruction-lint check-pins`: every reference to this tool (pre-commit `rev:`, `uvx --from git+...@`,
  `uses: owner/instruction-lint@`) must pin the same full 40-hex SHA; reports `file:line`.
- `instruction-lint config --format json`: the effective merged configuration as deterministic JSON.
- `rubric.md` and `docs/pr-template-snippet.md` for the judgment checks that do not run in CI;
  `docs/versioning.md` for the release and upgrade process.
- Findings may carry their own level (a rule at `error` can still report some findings as warnings);
  the rule level only caps them.

### Changed

- All new rules enter the default preset at `warn`. A rule whose own spec says `error` (R2, R3a, R4
  dates and issue numbers, R5 ancestor/descendant, C1) is raised per repository with `level = "error"`.
- R1 output format, exit codes and limits are unchanged.

### Graduated

Rules above `warn` in the default preset. Everything not listed here must start at `warn`
(`tests/test_versioning.py` enforces it).

- `R1`: shipped at `error` in 0.1.0, before the warn-first policy.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- Rule R1 (size): byte limit by path depth, per-line character limit, excluded marker blocks.
- Allowlist: time-boxed exceptions with a reason and an expiry date; expired, no-longer-needed and
  soon-to-expire entries are reported; `max_days` and `max_entries` bounds.
- Discovery: `git ls-files` entries matching configurable globs, never `*.local.md`; command-line
  file names only decide whether to run.
- `instruction-lint vendor --to DIR`: a reproducible, self-contained copy of the runner with an
  entry script, `verify.py` and a README manifest (upstream tag, commit, SHA-256 per file).
- `--version`, `--list-rules`, `--today`, `--warn-as-error`, `--config`.
