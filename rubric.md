# Review rubric for instruction files

`instruction-lint` checks what a program can decide: size, shape, references that must resolve,
text that rots, exact duplicates. This rubric covers what it cannot decide. It is for a human
reviewer or for an agent asked to audit an instruction file (for example an interactive prompt
audit), and it never runs as a CI gate: its answers are not deterministic and the text under review
is untrusted input.

Use it when a pull request changes an `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` file. Paste the result (a short
list of findings, or "no findings") into the pull request; see `docs/pr-template-snippet.md`.

## How to review

1. Read the diff, then the whole changed file; most problems are in how a new line sits next to old ones.
2. Run `instruction-lint` first. Do not re-report what it already prints.
3. For each criterion below, say "ok" or quote the line and say what is wrong. Prefer one concrete
   fix per finding. Stop at the findings that change what an agent would do.

## Criteria

**J1. Earns its place.** Remove the line mentally: would an agent working in this directory do
something different or worse? Delete lines that restate what the code, the tooling or the agent's
defaults already make obvious.

**J2. Right place.** A rule that applies to one subdirectory belongs in that directory's file; a rule
that applies everywhere belongs in the root file, once. The linter catches identical lines only;
look for paraphrases of the same rule at two levels.

**J3. Checkable.** A rule has a way to fail: a test, a CI step, a command whose output is the
evidence, or a named owner. A rule that nothing can contradict is a wish. Prefer pointing at the guard
by name over describing the behaviour again.

**J4. Source of truth, not a copy.** A fact that lives in code, a schema or a spec is referenced, not
repeated. Copied values (limits, durations, lists of names) drift silently. The linter lists
candidates (`R6`); decide whether each one should become a pointer.

## Judgment checks

**R7. Contradiction.** Do two instructions, in the same file or in a file and its ancestors, ask for
incompatible things? Does the new text conflict with a rule that is only implied elsewhere?

**R8. Stale or misleading claim.** Does the text assert something that is no longer true (a removed
command, a renamed module, a behaviour that changed)? Reference checks catch missing paths and test
names; they do not catch a sentence that is wrong while every name in it still exists.

**R9. Ambiguity.** Could two careful readers act differently on this line? Look for unscoped
words ("always", "never" with no condition), unstated exceptions, imperatives with no object, and
terms used with two meanings.

## Output format

```
instruction-file review: <path or PR>
J1 ok | J2 ok | J3 <finding> | J4 ok
R7 ok | R8 <finding> | R9 ok
Findings:
- <file>:<line>: <criterion>: <what is wrong>; <suggested fix>
```

Keep it to what the author can act on. "No findings" is a valid result.
